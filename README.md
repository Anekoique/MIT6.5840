All tests have been run more than 500 times, and most of them over 1,000 times. I’ve done my best to keep the code clean and elegant, but I can’t guarantee it’s bug-free. 

This is undoubtedly a challenging lab. I recommend setting aside contiguous time to complete it—doing the labs only on weekends meant I had to spend extra time reviewing earlier code details. 

Finally, the 5B/C code may not be particularly right; I don’t want to invest more time and energy polishing it.
